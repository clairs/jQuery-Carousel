jQuery Carousel - v1.0.1
------------------------

Requires: jQuery 1.4+

A slideshow. Currently only fades between items, for 10 seconds each (interval between items and transition effect will be implemented if there's demand for it)

To use:
In HTML, the slideshow must be in an unordered list with class 'carousel', with each item inside a list item, eg:
<ul class="carousel">
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<li>Item 2</li>
	<li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


(You can put almost anything inside the items as long as it's legal html (such as linked images), and you can give any element an extra class or id if you desire

To start the slideshow, use:
$(document).carousel();
